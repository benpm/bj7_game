## Brainstorm
- Idk i like to start backwards and think of a name first and go from there sometimes, here are some off the dome:
	- HYPERVIGILANT
	- Safari Datura
- *Amnesia: The Dark Descent* -esque insanity meter type sh, fighting off a constantly creeping delirium 
- As your sanity falls, the shadows begin to take humanoid form
- At first they are transient, and disappear as soon as they appear
- Then they start to move around, and you can talk to them
- You have to do something for them or they will start to turn on you
- You have limited **laudanum** 
- Fainting and waking up in a different level
- You are fading in and out of consciousness
- The levels change subtly every time you wake up
- The level of urgency in player is erratic
- Environments fade or smear out into infinity, no boundaries, nothing solid remains so
- SURVIVAL!!
	- Health/sanity bar that can be harshed upon in different ways in different environments
## Environments
### 1: Delirium
- **CONCEPT**: Things are quickly shifting and flowing and nonsensical.
- **GAMEPLAY**: Bullet hell. Bullets (shadows) phase in and out of existence.
- **ART**:
### 2: Dissociation
- **CONCEPT**: Everything is far away, as you approach something it fades. It's all disconnected.
- **GAMEPLAY**: RPG-like, interact with the aberrations and go through dialogue trees (pick the correct options to restore a little health, wrong pick hurts player). If player does nothing, fade to other state.
- **ART**:
### 3: Hypervigilance
- **CONCEPT**: Things are sharpened in spikes. Angles and focuses.
- **GAMEPLAY**: Player is static in center, has a 60* degree angle view. Attacks come from all 360 degrees. Player uses left/right arrows to look around, mouse click to kill enemy (dispel shadows).
- **ART**:

## Mechanics
### Health
When player reaches 0% health, assets and world are completely whited out. 
As player loses health, white vignette grows stronger and obscures vision more. Audio hum (white noise) gets louder.

### The Aberrations 
Hallucinations can hurt you if they persist for too long? Or if 

### Fainting / Level Transition
Game run takes 5 minutes

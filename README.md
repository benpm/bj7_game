# Hypnoscape Express
- Bevy Jam 7 submission
- Theme: ***"Extremely Incohesive Fever Dream"***

Unfortunately the surgery had complications, and you find yourself trapped in a withering dreamscape that seems to be trying to rip the very last shreds of sanity from you. 

You oscillate between three hypnogogic states - Delirium, Dissociation, and Hypervigilance. Each has different hazards, different ways to deceive and destroy you. Survive the dream by keeping the nightmares at bay.
